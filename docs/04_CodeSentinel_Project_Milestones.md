## 6. Detailed Technical Tasks

### 6.1 Core Agent Development & VCS Integration

*   **Task 1.1: Agent Core Framework Setup:** Initialize Python project, establish logging, configuration management, and error handling.
*   **Task 1.2: VCS Authentication Module:** Implement secure authentication with GitHub/GitLab using OAuth/App installations or personal access tokens.
*   **Task 1.3: Repository Cloning & Branching:** Develop functionality to clone repositories, create new branches for fixes, and manage branch lifecycles.
*   **Task 1.4: Commit & Push Module:** Implement git operations for committing changes and pushing to remote branches.
*   **Task 1.5: Pull Request Creation & Management:** Develop API interactions to create PRs, add descriptions, assign reviewers, and monitor PR status.

### 6.2 SonarQube Integration

*   **Task 2.1: SonarQube API Client:** Develop a Python client for the SonarQube Web API, specifically targeting `api/issues/search` for issue retrieval.
*   **Task 2.2: SonarQube Authenticated Ingestion:** Implement token-based authentication and pagination for fetching issues.
*   **Task 2.3: SonarQube JSON Parser:** Create a parser for SonarQube JSON output, extracting `key`, `rule`, `severity`, `component`, `line`, and `message`.
*   **Task 2.4: SonarQube Issue Mapping:** Map SonarQube issue types (e.g., `CODE_SMELL`, `BUG`) to internal remediation categories.
*   **Task 2.5: Initial SonarQube Remediation Strategies:** Develop LLM prompts and logic for fixing common code smells (e.g., unused imports, naming conventions).

### 6.3 Mend Integration

*   **Task 3.1: Mend API Client:** Develop a Python client for Mend Platform API 3.0, focusing on 
retrieving "Code Application Findings".
*   **Task 3.2: Mend Authenticated Ingestion:** Implement authentication using Mend User Keys and Organization Tokens.
*   **Task 3.3: Mend File Parsers (PDF/Excel/CSV):** Develop parsers for Mend reports. For PDF/Excel, investigate OCR or dedicated libraries for structured data extraction. For CSV, define column mapping for `Library`, `Vulnerability ID`, and `Top Fix`.
*   **Task 3.4: Mend Vulnerability Mapping:** Map Mend vulnerability data to internal remediation schemas.
*   **Task 3.5: Mend Remediation Strategies:** Develop LLM prompts and logic for fixing dependency vulnerabilities by suggesting version bumps.

### 6.4 Trivy Integration

*   **Task 4.1: Trivy API Client/Operator Integration:** Integrate with Trivy's client-server mode or operator for real-time vulnerability reports.
*   **Task 4.2: Trivy File Parser (JSON/SARIF):** Create a parser for Trivy JSON output, extracting `Vulnerabilities` array fields like `PkgName`, `InstalledVersion`, and `FixedVersion`.
*   **Task 4.3: Trivy Vulnerability Mapping:** Map Trivy vulnerability data to internal remediation schemas.
*   **Task 4.4: Trivy Remediation Strategies:** Develop LLM prompts and logic for fixing container/OS package vulnerabilities.

### 6.5 Remediation Engine Enhancement & Validation

*   **Task 5.1: Risk Assessment Module:** Implement logic to classify findings as "Low Risk" or "High Risk" based on predefined criteria.
*   **Task 5.2: Code Context Retrieval:** Develop functionality to fetch relevant code snippets and surrounding context from the VCS.
*   **Task 5.3: LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering:** Refine LLM integration for code generation, focusing on effective prompt engineering for various fix types.
*   **Task 5.4: Syntax Validation Module:** Integrate language-specific linters (e.g., `flake8`, `eslint`, `checkstyle`) to validate generated code.
*   **Task 5.5: Optional Build Verification Integration:** Develop hooks to trigger CI builds for pre-check validation (if CI environment is accessible).
*   **Task 5.6: LLM Self-Correction Mechanism:** Implement a feedback loop where validation failures are fed back to the LLM for iterative correction.

### 6.6 Testing, Deployment & Documentation

*   **Task 6.1: Unit Testing:** Develop comprehensive unit tests for all modules (parsers, API clients, remediation logic).
*   **Task 6.2: Integration Testing:** Conduct integration tests for each tool (SonarQube, Mend, Trivy) and VCS integration.
*   **Task 6.3: End-to-End Testing:** Perform end-to-end tests simulating the full workflow from issue ingestion to PR creation and validation.
*   **Task 6.4: Security Audit & Penetration Testing:** Conduct security audits and penetration testing of the agent and its integrations.
*   **Task 6.5: Deployment Strategy & Automation:** Define and automate deployment to containerized environments (Docker/Kubernetes).
*   **Task 6.6: Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement monitoring for agent performance, errors, and security events.
*   **Task 6.7: User Documentation:** Create detailed user guides, API documentation, and troubleshooting guides.
*   **Task 6.8: Training Materials:** Develop training materials for developers and security teams.
