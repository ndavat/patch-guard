## 4. Detailed Technical Tasks

### 4.1 Core Agent Development & VCS Integration

This phase establishes the foundational components of the AI Auto-Fixer and its interaction with version control systems. Key tasks include initializing the Python project with robust logging and configuration management, developing secure authentication modules for GitHub/GitLab, and implementing core Git operations such as repository cloning, branch creation, committing changes, and pushing to remote repositories. **Integration with MCP for Azure Repos and GitHub Repositories** will be established for streamlined VCS operations. Furthermore, API interactions for creating, managing, and monitoring Pull Requests will be developed to facilitate the human-in-the-loop review process.

### 4.2 SonarQube Integration

Integration with SonarQube involves developing a dedicated Python client for its Web API, specifically targeting the `api/issues/search` endpoint for efficient issue retrieval. This includes implementing token-based authentication and handling pagination for large datasets.A robust JSON parser will be created to extract critical issue details such as `key`, `rule`, `severity`, `component` (file path), `line`, and `message`. **Manual JSON input will also be supported.** These extracted issues will then be mapped to internal remediation categories, and initial LLM-driven remediation strategies will be developed for common code smells like unused imports and naming conventions violations.

### 4.3 Mend Integration

Mend integration focuses on Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vulnerabilities. A Python client for the Mend Platform API 3.0 will be developed to retrieve 
Code Application Findings, utilizing Mend User Keys and Organization Tokens for authentication. For file-based ingestion, parsers will be developed for PDF, Excel (.xlsx), CSV, and **JSON reports (manual JSON input supported)**. This will involve investigating OCR or specialized libraries for structured data extraction from PDF/Excel, and defining clear column mappings for CSV files to extract `Library`, `Vulnerability ID`, and `Top Fix` information. The extracted vulnerability data will be mapped to internal remediation schemas, and LLM-driven strategies will be developed for automated dependency version bumps.

### 4.4 Trivy Integration

Trivy integration will involve either integrating with Trivy's client-server mode or its operator for real-time vulnerability reporting. A dedicated parser will be developed for Trivy's JSON output, focusing on extracting the `Vulnerabilities` array and its key fields such as `PkgName`, `InstalledVersion`, `FixedVersion`, and `PrimaryURL`. **Manual JSON input will also be supported.** Similar to Mend, Trivy vulnerability data will be mapped to internal remediation schemas, and LLM-driven strategies will be developed to address container and operating system package vulnerabilities through automated updates.

### 4.5 Remediation Engine Enhancement & Validation

This critical phase focuses on refining the core intelligence of the agent. A robust risk assessment module will be implemented to classify findings as "Low Risk" or "High Risk" based on predefined criteria, ensuring that only safe issues are auto-fixed. The agent will be enhanced with context-aware code generation capabilities, retrieving relevant source code snippets and surrounding context from the VCS. **Advanced prompt engineering techniques will be developed to optimize LLM output for accuracy, context, and adherence to coding standards.** Configurable LLM options, including **GitHub Copilot (in auto-mode)**, GPT-4o, or Claude 3.5 Sonnet, will be integrated to optimize code generation for various fix types. To ensure the quality of generated fixes, a syntax validation module will be integrated with language-specific linters (e.g., `flake8`, `eslint`, `checkstyle`). Optionally, hooks will be developed to trigger CI builds for pre-check validation if a CI environment is accessible. Finally, an LLM self-correction mechanism will be implemented, allowing the agent to iteratively refine fixes based on validation failures.

### 4.6 Testing, Deployment & Documentation

This final phase encompasses comprehensive quality assurance, deployment preparation, and knowledge transfer. Extensive unit tests will be developed for all individual modules, including parsers, API clients, and remediation logic. Integration tests will verify the seamless interaction between the agent and each external tool (SonarQube, Mend, Trivy, and VCS). End-to-end tests will simulate the entire workflow from issue ingestion to validated PR creation. A thorough security audit and penetration testing will be conducted to ensure the agent's resilience against security threats. The deployment strategy will be defined and automated for containerized environments (Docker/Kubernetes), accompanied by the implementation of monitoring and alerting systems for performance, errors, and security events. Finally, comprehensive user documentation, API documentation, troubleshooting guides, and training materials will be developed to facilitate adoption and ongoing maintenance.
