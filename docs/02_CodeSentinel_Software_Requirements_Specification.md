# Software Requirements Specification: CodeSentinel

## 1. Introduction

The **CodeSentinel** is an enterprise-grade agent designed to automate the remediation of low-risk technical debt and security vulnerabilities. By integrating with leading static analysis and security scanning tools, the agent significantly reduces the manual burden on development teams, improves baseline code quality, and accelerates Pull Request (PR) cycles.

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the development of an AI-driven agent capable of ingesting scan results from **SonarQube**, **Mend**, and **Trivy**, and generating verified code fixes.

### 1.2 Scope
The agent focuses on "low-risk" issues, defined as those with high predictability and low impact on core business logic, such as code smells, formatting violations, and known dependency vulnerabilities with direct upgrade paths.

## 2. System Architecture & Integration Patterns

The agent operates as a bridge between security/quality scanning platforms and the source code repository. It supports two primary integration patterns to ensure compatibility with diverse enterprise environments.

### 2.1 Integration Matrix

| Component | Authenticated API Integration | File-Based Ingestion (Offline/CI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SonarQube** | REST API v2 (`api/issues/search`) | JSON (GitLab SAST or Sonar Export, **Manual JSON Input Supported**) |
| **Mend (SCA)** | Mend Platform API 3.0 | PDF, Excel (.xlsx), CSV Reports, **JSON (Manual JSON Input Supported)** |
| **Trivy** | Trivy Operator / Server API | JSON, SARIF, or CycloneDX (**Manual JSON Input Supported**) |
| **VCS** | GitHub App / GitLab Bot Token, **MCP for Azure/GitHub Repos** | N/A (Direct Repository Access) |

### 2.2 Data Ingestion Requirements

The system must implement robust parsers for each supported format, ensuring that critical metadata is extracted to guide the AI remediation engine.

| Tool | Format | Critical Data Fields to Extract |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SonarQube** | JSON | `key`, `rule`, `severity`, `component` (file path), `line`, `message` |
| **Mend** | PDF/Excel | `Vulnerability ID` (CVE), `Library Name`, `Current Version`, `Fixed Version` |
| **Mend** | CSV | Column mapping for `Library`, `CVE`, and `Remediation Recommendation` |
| **Trivy** | JSON | `Vulnerabilities` array: `PkgName`, `InstalledVersion`, `FixedVersion`, `PrimaryURL` |

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Autonomous Remediation Engine (ARE)

The ARE is the core intelligence of the agent, responsible for interpreting findings and generating code changes.

1.  **Risk Classification:** The agent must evaluate each finding against a "Safe-to-Fix" policy. Issues categorized as "High Risk" (e.g., complex architectural changes) must be flagged for manual intervention rather than auto-fixed.
2.  **Context-Aware Code Generation:** The agent must retrieve the relevant source code files and surrounding context (at least 50 lines above and below the finding) before invoking the LLM.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Employ advanced prompt engineering techniques to optimize LLM output for accuracy, context, and adherence to coding standards.
    *   **LLM Options:** Support for various LLMs, including **GitHub Copilot** (in auto-mode), GPT-4o, or Claude 3.5 Sonnet, configurable based on enterprise preference.
3.  **Remediation Logic:**
    *   **Code Smells:** Apply industry-standard refactoring patterns (e.g., removing unused imports, fixing naming conventions).
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Perform dependency version increments as specified in Mend or Trivy "Fixed Version" fields.
    *   **Security Patches:** Apply targeted code changes for simple vulnerabilities like insecure headers or hardcoded secrets.

### 3.2 Verification & Validation

To maintain enterprise-grade reliability, every fix must undergo a multi-stage validation process.

1.  **Syntax Validation:** The agent must run a language-specific linter (e.g., ESLint, Pylint, Checkstyle) on the modified file to ensure no syntax errors were introduced.
2.  **Build Verification (Optional):** If a CI environment is accessible, the agent should trigger a "Pre-check" build to verify that the project still compiles.
3.  **LLM Self-Correction:** If a validation step fails, the agent should feed the error message back into the LLM for a second attempt (maximum 3 retries).

### 3.3 Pull Request Workflow

The agent's primary output is a high-quality Pull Request that facilitates easy human review.

1.  **Branch Management:** Create a unique branch for each fix or batch of related fixes (e.g., `fix/sonar-debt-123`).
2.  **PR Documentation:** Each PR must include a structured description:
    *   **Summary:** A concise explanation of the change.
    *   **Source:** Reference to the SonarQube/Mend/Trivy finding ID.
    *   **Risk Level:** Justification for the "Low Risk" classification.
    *   **Validation Results:** Evidence of successful linting or build checks.
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop Interaction:** The agent must monitor PR comments. If a reviewer provides feedback (e.g., "Please use a different naming convention"), the agent must parse the comment and update the PR accordingly.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Security & Compliance

1.  **Credential Isolation:** API keys and VCS tokens must be retrieved from an enterprise secret manager at runtime and never logged.
2.  **Data Sovereignty:** The agent must support "On-Premise" or "Private Cloud" deployments to ensure source code never leaves the organization's network.
3.  **Auditability:** Maintain a tamper-proof log of all remediation actions, including the original finding, the generated fix, and the LLM prompt used.

### 4.2 Scalability

1.  **Parallel Execution:** The system must support concurrent processing of multiple repositories across different business units.
2.  **Rate Limit Awareness:** Implement exponential backoff and jitter when interacting with SonarQube, Mend, and GitHub APIs to avoid service disruptions.

## 5. Technology Stack Recommendations

*   **Orchestration:** Python-based agent framework (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI).
*   **Reasoning Engine:** Configurable LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, **GitHub Copilot**) for complex code reasoning and fix generation.
*   **Connectivity:** SonarQube MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for seamless issue retrieval. **MCP integration for Azure Repos and GitHub Repositories** for VCS operations (branch checkout, commit, push, PR creation).
*   **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes-based deployment for elastic scaling.
*   **Parsing:** Custom Python parsers for PDF (using `PyMuPDF`) and Excel (using `pandas`).
